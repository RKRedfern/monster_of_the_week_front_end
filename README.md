This program was created using a Rails back-end and the PostGres Database Gem. The link to the backend file can be accessed here : https://github.com/RKRedfern/monster_of_the_week_back_end

This program can be started by cloning both repositories, using bundle install, running < rails s > in the back-end console and running < open index.html > in the front end console.

This project is the first version of an X files trading card game with a custom curated database of our favorite X Files monsters.
